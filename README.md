# BudgetCuts2LIV
Adds LIV support to Budget Cuts 2 (and 1 Arcade), allowing for mixed reality capture or avatars in third person.

Currently there is some visual issues with the mod that Budget Cuts 1's pre-Arcade LIV native version did not have, such as teleport bubble is only an outline and appears on LIV's output as foreground.

Please be aware that if you stop using the mod you must remove the ExternalCamera.cfg file from Budget Cuts 1/2 game folder or it will have issues reaching the game menu.

# Installation

- Start Budget Cuts 1/2 from Steam, change Capture tab to Manual and select Budget Cuts exe (not Melon Loader).
