# BudgetCuts2LIV and BudgetCutsUltimateLIV
Mods that add LIV support allowing for mixed reality capture or avatars in third person to:
- Budget Cuts 2 (also works for Budget Cuts 1 "Arcade")
- Budget Cuts Ultimate (the 2023 release that combines BC 1/2 into a single game)

There is some visual issues with the mods that Budget Cuts 1's pre-Arcade LIV native version did not have, such as teleport bubble is only an outline and appears on LIV's output as foreground.

Please be aware that if you stop using the mod you must remove the ExternalCamera.cfg file from Budget Cuts 1/2 game folder or it will have issues reaching the game menu.
