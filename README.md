# BudgetCuts2LIV
Adds LIV support to Budget Cuts 2 (and 1 Arcade), allowing for mixed reality capture or avatars in third person.

There is also another mod BudgetCutsFixExternalCamera that just fixes the game starting up, not necessary with the LIV mod.

Please be aware that if you stop using either mod you must remove the ExternalCamera.cfg file from Budget Cuts 1/2 game folder or it will have issues reaching the game menu.

# Installation
- Download MelonLoader Installer and install 0.5.7 in either Budget Cuts 1/2 folder.
- From the BudgetCuts2LIV release zip, extract the folders Mods and UserLibs into either Budget Cuts 1/2 folder. 
- Start either game from LIV.

# Additional build instructions
Requires UniverseLib.IL2CPP.Unhollower.dll
